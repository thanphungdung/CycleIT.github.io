            <h2>2022 was the year of drought</h2>
            <p> It was a year characterized by extreme drought.

                From North America to Africa to Europe to Asia, huge swaths of the planet were parched in 2022. Lakes and rivers in several countries shrank to extreme lows and dry conditions threatened crops and fueled destructive wildfires across the globe.
                
                As the world warms, climate change will exacerbate drought conditions on the planet. Research has shown that global warming worsens drought by enhancing evaporation, depleting reservoirs and drying out soils and other vegetation.
                
                Here’s what drought this year looked like on four of the hardest-hit continents...</p>

            <h2>Empty nests: why UK's winter bird numbers are in sharp decline</h2>
            <p> Every winter’s evening, from November to February, one of the most dramatic of all our natural spectacles takes place on the Avalon Marshes, near my home in Somerset. Here, as dusk falls, up to half a million starlings – refugees from the far north and east – gather together in the skies, before roosting in the reedbeds below.

                Over the past few years, this has become quite a tourist attraction. On busy weekend afternoons, hundreds of people come to witness the starlings’ mesmeric aerial displays, known as murmurations, as huge numbers of birds twist and turn against the setting sun...
